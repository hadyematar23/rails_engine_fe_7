# Consuming your Rails Engine API

This project is a front-end extension to the original [Rails Engine Lite project](https://github.com/hadyematar23/rails_engine_repo). 

It consumes the original Rails Engine Lite (which runs on Port 3000). 

To run this in conjunction with the Rails Engine Light, this is programmed to run on Port 5000.
